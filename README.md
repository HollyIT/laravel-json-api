# Laravel JsonApi

## Description

This is an extremely simple JsonApi implementation. It does not follow the spec exactly
(ie: links are not included). It provides filtering, include and sorts and only renders
resource listings and views. 

## Instructions

None yet. This is very much a WIP. If you're looking for a full Json:API solution, then please
check out [this project](https://laravel-json-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
